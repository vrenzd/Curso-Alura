To the north lies Woodland Park, which features athletic fields, a skate park, tennis courts, and connections to the Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake (all walking distance from the house). Fremont, just a little South West (over the Aurora Pedestrian bridge), is the Center of the Universe. Here you have \"De Libertas Quirkas\" (\"Freedom to be Peculiar\"). This is an art\\'s neighborhood with theaters, restaurants, bars, ice cream, shops, Lenin, a large troll, and the Fremont Rocket. A Sunday Market happens each week, which is full of great eats and shopping. Plenty of activities in the neighborhood: kayaking on Lake Union, biking the Burke Gilman, wa', 'You will truly enjoy our neighborhood -- as long as you don\\'t mind getting in shape and walking a few hills and \"urban staircases.\" There are tons of choices nearby sure to entertain every type of traveler - from fantastic restaurants and boutique shops, to hiking and biking trails.

The neighborhood has a diverse history, which is seen throughout public art and community events, like the Nude Cyclists in the Solstice Parade. And Gasworks Park– the hidden gem of Seattle–is a mere 25 minute walk away. The smaller, quaint lot, Peak Park, has a great view of the sunset over Ballard, and is only 5 minutes away. I'm also by the Woodland Park Zoo, several killer local restaurants & independent shops, and the Green Lake hiking trails/day use park. If there's something more you want, I'll help you find it!\", \"The neighborhood is amazing.  It's super quirky. There's a giant cement troll across the street, and a giant statue of communist Lenin!  We've got a lot of local shops and restaurants a block away.  Everything imaginable is within walking distance.

More info about Ballard:  + a 5-minute drive from Golden Gardens beach (with amazing sunset views of Elliot Bay and the Olympic Mountains) + a 20-minute drive from downtown (or, a 30-minute bus ride if you\\'d prefer to avoid the expense of parking) + a charming neighborhood, home to dozens of quaint boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants featuring many different types of cuisines (Frenc', 'Our home is in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, which is a direct bus or bike ride  to downtown Seattle. Ballard, in of itself, is also a very desirable neighborhood to explore with its beaches, historic district, the locks, the zoo, and fabulous restaurants.  ', 'Ballard is one of the best neighborhoods in the city, all biases aside! It offers tons of fun shops, local restaurants, bars, parks, cafes, farmers markets, scenic access to the Puget Sound, and lots of fun nightlife. The heart of downtown Ballard is an easy 1.5 miles from our home.   Within 3 blocks of our home you can walk to “one of the city\\'s best food microhoods\" as described by Seattle Met. This includes Delancey\\'s, an amazing wood-fired pizzeria; Essex, a London inspired pub serving craft cocktails and small plates with a tasty Northwest twist; Honore Bakery known as one of the best French bakeries throughout the city; The Fat Hen a rustic Italian bistro with European flare serving breakfast/brunch items; Brunswick & Hunt a \"farm to neighborhood\" restaurant offering seasonal menu items, and if you\\'re looking to let loose, head to Tarasco\\'s known as one of the best karaoke bars. Downtown Ballard, Phinney Ridge, Fremont, Green Lake, & Wallingford neighborhoods are all a quick 1-3 ', \"Pinehurst/Victory Heights is a tree-lover's paradise.  It is nestled between Northgate and Lake City in beautiful and convenient Northeast Seattle. You are within easy walking distance of many lovely restaurants, an excellent local brewery, and German cafe.\", 'Quiet, slow paced. Victory Heights is a \"pocket neighborhood\".  It\\'s secluded with parks and green spaces and easy walkability to Thornton Creek. The neighborhood has some of the original houses built from the early 1920\\'s to after WWII, all built on large lots.  You\\'ll discover how convenient the quiet neighborhood is to bus lines and I-5.', \"We live in a very walkable (77/100 on Zillow scale) family neighborhood that is close to many major express bus lines. We are 15-20 minutes from downtown Seattle (depending on traffic). Off the beaten path, but close enough to be convenient for your Seattle visit. Please see our location on a map to get a better idea of the location. The best thing about the cabin is the privacy you'll enjoy.  This neighborhood developed in the years following WWII and is called Victory Heights. Some great local businesses include Kafeeklatsch Coffee (and bakery!), Elliot Bay Brewery, Aloha Ramen, and Toyoda Sushi.  There are four grocery stores close to our house.

Lots of opportunities nearby for dining, shopping, walking. Great micro-neighborhood around the corner with amazing restaurants (Delancey, Essex, The Fat Hen, Honore). ', \"We searched far and wide for a property that was close enough to Seattle but still very private and serene.  Olympic Hills / Lake City is very peaceful and walkable/bikeable, but most people hop on a bus to downtown.  We listed our favorite local venues in the Guidebook below - check 'em out! Within a 10 minute walk, you will find: -Kaffeeklatsch and Bean City Coffee Company -Hellbent Brewery on 130th and Lake City Way -Elliot Bay Brewing and The Beer Authority -Lake City Farmer's Market (Thursdays)\", \"You'll fall in LOVE with Lower Queen Anne and Belltown...and make your way up the hill to Upper Queen Anne.

Walk to everything.', \"Don't miss out on the views from Kerry Park (Just 3 blocks from my place) and walk down to the water to Olympic Sculpture Park.\", '--', \"It's pretty quiet neighborhood, just two blocks away from the space needle and Keyarena, close to walk to Belltown and easy to take bus to go Ballard.\", \"We are just around the corner from Sunset Hill Park which has an even more expansive view than our home does.  Seven blocks away you'll find the top of a long set of stairs through the woods to Golden Gardens beach.  We are 1.5 miles up the hill from the Locks, the Burke Gilman bike Trail, and downtown Ballard.  Ours is a beautiful part of town - quiet and peaceful \", '--', 'Phinney Ridge is a very safe, family friendly, and walkable neighborhood, close to bus lines to downtown. Our home is near restaurants, pubs, bakeries, cafes and parks. There are Saturday and Sunday farmers markets nearby. We are only a 15 minute drive from a public beach, near a chip and putt golf course, and a lake where one can boat or swim.', \"We love our neighborhood because it is quiet, but in the middle of the urban setting.  Our house is equally convenient for urban outings or outdoor active pursuits. Highlights: Greenlake, Woodland Park Zoo, Carkeek Park, easy access to Seattle Pacific Univ and University of Washington.   Vibrant neighborhoods in walking distance: Fremont, Ballard, Greenwood, Greenlake Downtown - 15 minute drive or 25 minutes on the bus (bus stop just 1/2 block away).

Yoga, Pilates, dance, the library and post office just a hop skip and jump from the green house.\", 'West Seattle is a thriving urban neighborhood with the feel of a charming small town. The apartment is poised on a bluff with a sweeping view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Blake Island, Vashon Island, and Bainbridge Island are visible, as are constant cargo ship, sailboat, and ferry traffic. Easy walk to the beach.', \"We're close to Lincoln Park, 10 minutes from a grocery store (QFC) and Starbucks, both at Westwood Village mall, and near a whole slew of Seattle parks. The closest one, Highland Park, has a spray park water feature, as well as swings and the usual climbing structures.\", '--', 'Broadview is a lovely part of Seattle.  Minutes from Carkeek Beach Park, lots of restaurants within walking distance, but also quiet at night.', 'We live in a friendly neighborhood with many foot and bike paths.  Just a short walk away is Carkeek Park which is a vast family oriented park with many hiking trails, kid playgrounds, and access to a stunning view of Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains, Bainbridge Island and a lovely walking beach often inhabited with Bald Eagles and Great Blue Herons.  ', \"We're about a 10 minute walk from great restaurants, shopping, library, a movie theater, and coffee shops up on 45th.  If you're looking for fine dining, try Joule and The Whale Wins, just down the street on Stone Way. For runners and bikers the Burke Gilman trail is just a few blocks away, Greenlake is a few minutes to the north and has a beautiful 3-mile loop. For a longer stretch (or some paddle boarding), it's 6 miles around the gorgeous Lake Union! Golden Gardens beach and Discovery Park are two easy-to-get-to spots that are great to spend part of the afternoon soaking in the beauty of the NW.  \", \"Fremont is hip and charming. There are many eclectic restaurants and shops within walking distance. We particularly love the Sunday Farmers market.  We suggest checking out the Fremont Troll, Gas Works Park, and walking the Burke Gilman Trail.  Fremont is also minutes from the Ballard neighborhood. There are many great eats and shops there as well. We're big foodies and provide a list of restaurants to try in the unit.\", \"I love my neighborhood for all the reasons I've listed above, and because of the community feel here.  The Fremont Arts Council and the Fremont Abbey for arts and performance oriented  creativity and activities, the Chamber for growing and sustaining businesses, and the local color everywhere.   Walking along the Burke Gilman Trail at the base of Phinney Avenue by the life sized dinosaur topiaries is a great way to spend time and get a ground level view of the canal and all the boats and ships that pass by.  Stopping at the Lighthouse Roaster for incredibly delicious coffee and a variety of teas gives you a taste of a local and very popular neighborhood meeting place. Following the many connecting stairways and paths in the area gives you a very special experience of this great neighborhood.  There is a newly finished neighborhood stair case on Greenwood Avenue.  Great for step training!   Link to typical tourist sites and some great alternatives: (URL HIDDEN) hidden)/html/travel(phone\", 'There is a reason Fremont is know in Seattle as “the center of the universe\" as it truly is central to everything. The property is located an ideal distance from the University of Washington (1.4 miles) and Seattle Pacific University (1 mile) and just moments to Downtown Seattle by car, cab, or bus (4.1 miles). Right between the vibrant Wallingford and Ballard neighborhoods, Fremont is filled with cafes, shops, restaurants, pubs, and fine dining and all within walking distance from your VRBO doorstep. ', '--', '--', 'Upper Fremont is a walkable neighborhood of single houses, townhouses and small condominium buildings. Some of the best restaurants (Roux, Rock Creek, Vif) in town are walking minutes away, as is Book Larder for author readings and Fremont Abbey for concerts (e.g. the Moth radio show). Walk downhill to bars and live music venues near the Ship Canal or uphill to Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake.', \"Fremont is a wonderful, and somewhat eclectic, neighborhood filled with a variety of fantastic restaurants, bars/breweries/distilleries, grocery stores, shops, theaters, libraries/bookstores, and gyms – all within a walkable mile of our home. It's also become somewhat of a high-tech mecca for companies like Adobe, Gøøgle, and Tableau as well as several startups. We particularly love living near a chocolate factory and a bug-eating troll as well as being able to easily walk to Woodland Park Zoo, Green Lake, Lake Union, the Burke Gilman Trail, and Gas Works Park. Buses to Downtown and Ballard/UW are super convenient – stops are one block away, buses generally run every 15 minutes, and the fare is $2.50-$2.75 depending on time and day.

Seattle lives in its neighborhoods and this is one of it's best ones.  From my place you can walk 2 blocks into the center of things where you can find enough to entertain you for days on end.  Want to go up to Ballard, over to Gasworks Park, or downtown?  Grab a bike and be anywhere in 10-15 minutes!  \", \"Fremont is a funky, creative neighborhood about four miles north of downtown Seattle. As the self-proclaimed Center of the Universe with year-round unexpected and unconventional entertainment, trolls who live under bridges, statues of communist leaders, and Cold War-era rocket on top of a boutique. We know how to make and have fun. It's full of fantastic local shops, eateries and bars, and its central location provides a perfect base from which to explore the rest of the city. Enjoy our walkability:  The Woodland Park Zoo, with its beautiful rose garden – 5 min walk  Gasworks Park, with a gorgeous view of the city and Lake Union – 20 min walk  You'll be just 2 or 3 blocks away from establishments in Seattle's Upper Fremont cluster including the popular Paseo's (amazing Caribbean sandwiches), Swingside Cafe (excellent Italian), Uneeda Burger (gourmet burgers and salads), Via Tribunali (wood-fired pizza), Pecado Bueno (Mexican, with a bar around an outdoor fire pit), Ha! (American/bar), \", \"This is my favorite location I have ever lived in. It's less than a 10 minute walk both to Fremont and Wallingford, two of Seattle's hottest neighborhoods. For a nice night out (2014 James Beard Chef Award Semifinalist) Art of the Table is just across the street. It's also a short walk to Gasworks Park, Burke Gilman Trail, and Lake Union.\", 'I am equidistant to Fremont and Wallingford and both have AMAZING restaurants, great parks, coffee houses, and bars (from divey to uppity).  Some highlights: Gas Works Park:  10 Minute walk away with postcard like views of the lake and city.   Fremont Brewery:  4 blocks away and the best micro brewery in the (website hidden) garden with free pretzels! Molly Moons:  Best ice cream in Seattle!  (but often a line) Fremont Sunday Market:  Sunday Morning Market with crafts, food, and general fun.  Open year round!

The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it \"a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.\" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Plac",

Downtown Columbia City is within a mile, with all sorts of great eateries, the excellent Columbia City bakery, and some fine pubs with live music, a movie theater, a kids' shop, plus lots of other unique stores. You won't want to miss the glorious Columbia City Farmer's Market ( Wednesdays, 3-7pm, May-October) with lots of organic produce, gorgeous flowers, delectable samples, hot foods to go, and live music!  Great Neighbors!I am blessed with wonderfully kind helpful neighbors in this multicultural neighborhood!",

The bathroom is upstairs and is shared. We have a kitchen that you are welcome to make full use of! The nice thing about West Seattle is that it is quiet but still close to downtown. We have a bus stop about 20 yards from us with a bus to downtown that comes quiet often (every 20 minutes usually). To get downtown it only takes about 15 minutes and if you enjoy riding bikes there are some lovely paths. We do have a dog so if you are allergic this may not be ideal for you. Otherwise, we are both respectful of other people and you are welcome to watch movies with us (we don't have cable) or just hang out. We both work jobs that sometimes have strange hours but with enough notice can show you around the city! The one thing that we do ask is that you take a look at the check in/check out times. We are flexible with enough notice.  Once you ha",

If you enjoy sleeping in cave-like environments, you will not be disappointed here. The house is over a hundred years old, so it does accumulate dusty fairly easily and is in need of some paint touch-ups, but it's got a ton of character that makes up for it. :) You're welcome to access all areas of the house besides our private rooms (obviously) and basement music studio when we aren't home.
